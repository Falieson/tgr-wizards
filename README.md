## The base stack isn't ready for prod

- the stack is made for app development
- it uses webpack-dev-server to deliver a standard development environment
- production stage for the tgr-app isn't done yet, which means the goal of being able to run `nps build.prod` and get a dist/ that can be consumed by `tgr-mono`(monolith) or `tgr-fullstack`(prototyping) apps.
- this app does't include an express-server so running `build.prod` doesn't give you something easily useable.

## TL;DR;

- The #1 LI in the "Docs" list below has lots of info about the underlying stack
- the only thing you really need to know to get started are 2 commands: `npm i -D && nps`

## A bit more...

- `s?css.d.ts` is generated by the webpack watcher
